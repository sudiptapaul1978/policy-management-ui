PolicyMgmtUi

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.4.7. Install angular cli through node.

npm install -g @angular/cli

Open cmd from your desired folder and execute the below command:

ng new policy-mgmt-ui --style scss

This will create an Angular 2 project named policy-mgmt-ui

Integrating Bootstrap CSS with the app

Run the commands given below:

cd policy-mgmt-ui

npm install bootstrap-sass –save

In the src/assets/ directory, create a directory named bootstrap-sass with an empty file named: _variables.scss. In the _variables.scss file, paste the content from: node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss In the _variables.scss file, find the line with $icon-font-path and change it to point to the proper directory: $icon-font-path: "../node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap/" !default; In src/styles.scss, add the following:

@import "assets/bootstrap-sass/variables";

@import '../node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap';

To check that bootstrap css is working we will just write a bit of test code in app.component.html

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6"> col-md-6 </div> <div class="col-md-6"> col-md-6</div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8"> col-md-8 </div> <div class="col-md-4"> col-md-4</div>
  </div>
</div>
And then execute: ng serve –open

Development server

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Or type ng serve --open which will directly open the app in your default browser.

Code scaffolding

Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

Build

Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.

Running unit tests

Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.

Running end-to-end tests

Run ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.

Deploying in Pivotal Cloud Foundry

Run the below commands from policy-mgmt-ui directory one after the other

ng build

For prod build use: ng build -prod
cd dist

cf push -b staticfile_buildpack policy-mgmt-ui

Check if everything is working fine by opening the url of policy-mgmt-ui app deployed in pcf.
